Our exploration of the EIA's data regarding renewable energy integration and grid outages reveals the effect of extreme weather events on electricity outages, highlighting one of the biggest dangers to the grid: the increasing frequency and intensity of these events. From severe storms to wildfires and hurricanes, extreme weather poses a significant threat to the stability and reliability of our energy infrastructure. To address this challenge, the future of the energy system must prioritize resilience, ensuring that grids are robust enough to withstand and adapt to these growing risks.

The National Centers For Environmental Information and [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/events/US/1990-2024?disasters[]=all-disasters) have a database of weather and climate disasters, and they keep track of the ones that caused damages over $1 billion.

When all disaster types are selected, the most notable trend is the significant rise in severe storms, which show the highest upward trajectory among all disaster types. The cumulative impact of these disasters is particularly striking, as the total number of events has steadily grown, especially since the mid-2000s. This pattern highlights a concerning escalation in the frequency of these costly weather events, emphasizing the need for robust climate resilience of the U.S. electricity grid.
