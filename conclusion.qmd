No clear pattern from scatterplot by state. Possible that reliability slightly decreases as penetration increases. Look into coloring by region given in tables. Look into coloring by ISO state groupings. Look into other years.

Not a final product graph since she doesn't want time series that don't have time on x-axis, but gives us look at multiple years distributions. Regress on multiple years? Look at earlier years?

Scatterplot by No Major Events

color scatterplot by ISO groupings
color scatterplot by regions from tables
color scatterplot by climate region (re: weather events, # of sunny days, inches of rain)

create mosaic based on thresholds in penetration and reliability
